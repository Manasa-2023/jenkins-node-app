# Jenkins CI/CD for Node.js App

This project demonstrates a basic CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins**, **Node.js**, and **Docker**.

## What I Have Done

- Created a sample Node.js app (`app.js`, `package.json`)
- Wrote a `Dockerfile` to containerize the app
- Created a `Jenkinsfile` with these pipeline stages:
  - Checkout code from GitHub
  - Install Node.js dependencies (`npm install`)
  - Build Docker image
  - (Optional) Test and Deploy steps

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Docker
- Jenkins
